        <strong>Updates to this Cookie Policy </strong><br />
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect,
        for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational,
        legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie
        Statement regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and
        related technologies.<br />

        <strong>What is a cookie? </strong><br />
        ‘Cookies’ are small text files that websites may place on your computer,
        mobile phone and other devices. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
        efficiently. Cookies are also used to remember what you have done on a
        website in order to improve your browsing experience, to help remember
        logins and any preferred settings, or to provide advertising while
        visiting a particular site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner are called “first party cookies”.
        Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third
        party cookies”. Third party Cookies enable third party features or
        functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., like
        advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set
        these third-party cookies can recognise your computer both when it
        visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other
        websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What is a Web Beacon?</strong><br />
        Web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”) are
        images embedded in a web page. Website owners may use web beacons to
        better understand what customers are interested in and to improve
        communication with customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How do we use Cookies or other similar technologies?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We use cookies to deliver a smooth experience when you use our Website
        and to help us understand how visitors use our Websites, so we can
        provide you with relevant content and continually improve the service we
        provide you.
      </p>
      <p>We use different types of cookies for different functions.</p>
      <p>
        A list of all the cookies we use, along with our advert network and
        technology partners can be found in
        <a href="/our-cookie-list">our cookie list</a>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Do I have a choice over the use of cookies? </strong></p>
      <p>Yes. There are several options available.</p>
      <p>
        It’s important to remember, however, that without cookies our website
        may not function as you expect it to and this could lead to a poor
        experience on our site for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, it’s important you adjust your settings to what you feel
        comfortable with. Strictly Necessary Cookies cannot be switch off. You
        can set your browser either to reject all other cookies, to only allow
        ‘trusted’ sites to set them, or to accept only those cookies from those
        websites which you are using at that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the ‘popular’ browsers allow you to change your cookie settings.
        These settings are usually found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu
        of your browser. To help you better understand these settings, the
        following links may be helpful to you, otherwise you should use the
        ‘Help’ option in your browser for more details.

        <strong>Disqus</strong><br />
        Discus provides discussion forum software enabling us to plug powerful
        functionality into our sites and engage in conversations with viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>LinkedIn</strong><br />
        We use the LinkedIn ‘Insight Tag’ for remarketing to website visitors.
        This helps us provide a richer experience to users and provides us with
        data to help improve our websites and advertising campaigns.
      </p>

        users to post information, articles or stories from our sites to their
        LinkedIn account. Using this function requires the user to enter their
        LinkedIn account details, but neither this nor any other personal
        information is collected by GSMA in this process.

        <strong>Salesforce</strong><br />
        We use Salesforce to manage our email campaigns as well our CRM systems.
        Additionally we use Salesforce DMP as our data management platform. It
        is used to help us better understand our audience and to serve more
        relevant advertising based on your browsing activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Facebook Connect and Social Plugins</strong><br />
        We use the Facebook ‘Pixel’ for remarketing to website visitors on
        Facebook and Instagram. This helps us provide a richer experience to
        users and provides us with data to help improve our websites and
        advertising campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facebook social plugins are things like the Like button, the Share
        button, comments and other tools that let you share your experience off
        of Facebook with your friends and others on Facebook.
